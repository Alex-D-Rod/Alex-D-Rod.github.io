Hey! Thanks for visiting my page. I'm currently a Ph.D student at [Florida International University](https://case.fiu.edu/mathstat/), working under Professor Svetlana Roudenko. Currently I am interested in studying dynamics of nonlinear PDE both analytically and numerically. I also enjoy mentoring undergraduate students via FIU's directed reading program and [REU](https://case.fiu.edu/mathstat/opportunities/amrpu/) program.

Outside of math I enjoy playing video games, playing soccer, hanging out with friends, and taking care of my fish.
