We study the focusing stochastic nonlinear Schroedinger equation in one spatial dimension with multiplicative noise,
driven by a Wiener process in the L^2 -critical and supercritical cases. We investigate how the energy is affected by
spatially correlated random perturbations, the influence of the noise on the global dynamics measuring the probability of
blow-up versus scattering behavior, and the effect of the spatially correlated noise on the blow-up behavior. We conclude
that such random perturbations do not influence the blow-up dynamics, except for shifting of the blow-up center location.
Based on joint work with A. Millet, S. Roudenko and K. Yang.
