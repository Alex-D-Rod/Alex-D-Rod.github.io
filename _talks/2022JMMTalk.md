We consider the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with finitely many combined nonlinearities. We investigate the local well-posedness of this equation for any positive powers and a certain class of initial data, subset in H^1. Using the pseudo-conformal transformation, we obtain global solutions (in the focusing case). Solutions with the quadratic phase and a sufficiently large positive exponent scatter in H^1. In the focusing case we also investigate scattering and blow-up numerically and show examples. (Based on the joint work with G. Azcotia, O. Riaño, S. Roudenko and H. Wubben)
